            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>My name is Zichun Zhu, and I am a PhD student at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at The University of Queensland (UQ). I am working under the supervision of Dr. Wen Hua from EECS and Dr. Jiwon Kim from the School of Civil Engineering. My research focuses on Spatial Data Mining and Spatial-Temporal data processing.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Infectious Disease (Malaria) Modelling (Mar 2019 - July 2020)</h3>
            <p>This project involved developing a population model that integrates within-host dynamics to explore the complex epidemic behaviors of Malaria parasites. The model, which is based on a customized agent-based approach and implemented in Python, provides insights into the intricate lifecycle of Malaria and its impact on population-level disease transmission.</p>

            <h3>Bluetooth Map Matching (April 2021 - Present)</h3>
            <p>This project tackles the challenges associated with Bluetooth map-matching, focusing on issues like the high complexity of large road networks, the absence of ground-truth data, and the varying levels and types of noise. The work has resulted in the publication of a paper, which can be accessed here: <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214953">IEEE Xplore</a>.</p>
